# Overview


The game rules are a combination of the map based strategy game Risk, and the ancient game Go. It is designed to never end, and as a result is impossible to win conclusively.

The player is designated by a ERC721 token called the Avatar. Any wallet containing the corresponding avatar token inherits control of the resources belonging to that avatar. 

There are two types of tiles, land and water. In gameplay their only difference is the ability to mine. 

There is also a fungible token used in gameplay called AUR. This token is an abstraction of resources and can be mined at a designated rate per block passed, per tile of land. 


AUR can be held in a map/planet contract, on a tile, or in a wallet. 

A transaction must be sent to mine your AUR. The resulting AUR will be minted and added to the balance of the avatar in the given map.
